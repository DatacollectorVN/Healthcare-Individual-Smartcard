# Healthcare Individual Smartcard (HI card)
This is our Capstone Project in **Biomedical Engineering** Deparmant in **International University - VNU-HCM**. 

Please read installation instruction in the `setup` part.

*Note:* Our majority is data engineer not mobile app developer. Therefore, we know this repository have messy and stupid source code ðŸ¥² ðŸ¥², hope to get positive feedbacks from you ðŸ¥¹.

## 1. Scope of this project
The goal of this project is to design a mobile application that scans individual QR cards to connect to the nearest hospital in the case of an emergency. After scanning, the app automatically updates all individual information as well as the location of patients.

In this repository, we developed the *front-end* of application based on **React Native** and deploy it by **Expo**
